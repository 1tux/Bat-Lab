25. UPSAMPLING!
26. document the bat lab project
30. store the unscaled coefficients
32. play with thresholds -> plot feature importances as function of the threshold (maybe high-frequency spikes have different meaning)
33. to implement simulated neuron creation, and store as csv
35. find a threshold (20% -> from all session, being with the recorded bat) removing a bat rather then removing the day
36. fixing the aggretaed sparsity
37. shuffles from other days instead of the same day


28. add output directory as a parameter V
29. save model's coefficients for the SVM (instead of saving the model) V
27. add neuron_name to output directory V
31. add with_pairs configuration V
34. plots behavioral plots as dots not lines. V
38. Pop up results directory at the end V

39. stores the execution line
40. stores the log (outputs)
41. the plot should be named according the neuron_id and neuron_day.
42. copy the plots to "plots directory".
43. add TESTs with pytest.
44. add git support for the project.
45. add "batch" file that fetch and updates the project.
46. add "get parsed neural data files" feature
